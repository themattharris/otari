# AGENTS.md

Guidance for agentic coding tools working in this repository.
Scope: entire repo.

`CLAUDE.md` is a one-line `@AGENTS.md` import of this file, not a symlink, so it survives Windows clones (Git for Windows checks symlinks out as plain text files by default). Always edit `AGENTS.md` directly; never modify `CLAUDE.md`. The same pairing is used in `web/` and `src/gateway/`.

## Project Snapshot
- Project: `otari`, an OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway (API key management, budget enforcement, usage tracking). The Python package is named `gateway` (not `otari`): the `otari` distribution name on PyPI belongs to the Otari client SDK, which `any-llm-sdk` depends on, so a top-level `otari` import package here would collide with it. User-facing names (CLI, env vars, docs, OpenAPI title) are `otari`; only the internal import path stays `gateway`. The laptop-side code (the Agent Guardrails evaluator, the Claude Code transcript parser) lives in a uv workspace member at `cli/` (distribution `otari-agent`, import package `otari_agent`), which the gateway depends on and which may not import the gateway back.
- Provider calls go through the `any-llm` SDK (`any_llm`), not hand-rolled HTTP clients. A change to how a provider call is made may not belong in this repo. Decide that before implementing, and say which side you landed on: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#is-this-an-otari-change-or-an-any-llm-change).

## Skills & Scoped Instructions
Detailed, task-scoped guidance lives outside this file so it loads only when relevant
(progressive disclosure). Read the applicable one before editing:

- **Backend (`src/gateway/`)** → [src/gateway/AGENTS.md](src/gateway/AGENTS.md) (request lifecycle, budget enforcement, built-in tools, data/sessions, config layering, DB + logging patterns) and [.github/skills/backend-standards/SKILL.md](.github/skills/backend-standards/SKILL.md): async SQLAlchemy house style, layering, the budget/reservation lifecycle, migrations, config/logging conventions.
- **Dashboard (`web/`)** → [web/AGENTS.md](web/AGENTS.md) (auth/session model, runtime provider management, build + bundled guide, PWA, serving) and [.github/skills/frontend-standards/SKILL.md](.github/skills/frontend-standards/SKILL.md): HeroUI v3, the semantic design tokens rehomed from `otari-ai/frontend`, TanStack Query patterns, component architecture, responsiveness, layout stability, performance under the React Compiler, and the three test suites. Its topic guides load one at a time; the SKILL indexes them.
- **Reviewing a PR or a diff** → [.github/skills/review/SKILL.md](.github/skills/review/SKILL.md): the procedure (which scoped guidance to load for which paths), the repo-specific gates that have broken a PR here before, and how findings are expressed.
- **Taking an issue to a ready PR** → [.github/skills/pr-cycle/SKILL.md](.github/skills/pr-cycle/SKILL.md): the implement, self-review, open, request-review, fix loop, including which checks and generated artifacts a PR owes, how to read back the inline comments of CodeRabbit, the one bot that reviews here, and what the repo's squash-merge and its `protect-main` ruleset mean for merging.
- **Reviewing a change** → the scoped files in [.github/instructions/](.github/instructions/), which CodeRabbit loads as review guidance (`.coderabbit.yaml` globs the directory under `knowledge_base.code_guidelines`): [backend-architecture](.github/instructions/backend-architecture.instructions.md) (the modular monolith's layer, service and import rules), [security-review](.github/instructions/security-review.instructions.md) (budget/tenant isolation, auth, SSRF, prompt injection) and [performance-review](.github/instructions/performance-review.instructions.md) (N+1, indexes, pagination limits, transaction atomicity) for `src/gateway/`, and [frontend-standards](.github/instructions/frontend-standards.instructions.md) (HeroUI v3, design tokens, TanStack Query, mobile, layering, tests) for `web/`.

The `.claude/skills` directory symlinks to `.github/skills`, so a skill is written once and reached from either path.

**Adding guidance: pick the narrowest layer that covers it, and link rather than restate.**
This file is loaded every session, so it carries only what applies repo-wide plus the pointers
above. A scoped `AGENTS.md` (`web/`, `src/gateway/`) describes the structure of its directory,
loaded when you work there. A skill carries the house style for writing code inside that
structure, loaded on demand. `.github/instructions/` is the one place restatement is expected,
because it loads for a different reader (CodeRabbit) that never sees the rest. Everywhere
else, a fact told in two layers is a fact that will go stale in one of them, and the stale copy
is the one someone believes.

For the frontend pair, that drift now fails a test rather than waiting to be noticed.
`scripts/rule_coverage/frontend-standards.txt` classifies every `##`/`###` heading of the skill
as `[covered]` by a numbered rung of the instructions or `[excluded]` with a reason, and
`tests/unit/test_frontend_rule_coverage.py` asserts the map is total both ways: an unclassified
heading fails, an entry naming a heading that is gone fails, and so does a rung no heading maps
to. Adding a section to a topic guide therefore owes one manifest line. `[excluded]` is the
common answer, because much of the skill is how to write code rather than what to flag in a
diff; the point is that the answer is recorded rather than assumed. The check is structural, not
a prose comparison: the two layers say the same thing in deliberately different words, and the
instructions carry an order of magnitude fewer rungs than the skill has headings, so anything
comparing wording would fight that compression forever.

## Architecture (Big Picture)
For the open-core OSS/enterprise seam (ports, adapters, the capability lines, and the rules for keeping the boundary), see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). It is a north-star document describing the intended architecture, so ground current-state work in `src/gateway/`.

Read it before adding a capability, introducing a port, or moving code across a layer. [Where new code goes](ARCHITECTURE.md#where-new-code-goes) says which kind of change lands where, and [Cardinal rules for contributors](ARCHITECTURE.md#cardinal-rules-for-contributors) holds the rules that keep the seam from eroding. Those rules are not advisory prose: the architecture check under [Lint / Typecheck](#lint--typecheck) is their mechanical half, and the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md) asks a change that alters a rule in `ARCHITECTURE.md` or in that script to name the rule and say why.

### Runtime modes
- Mode is derived when `OTARI_MODE` is unset, and honored when set: `GatewayConfig.is_hybrid_mode` / `effective_mode` (`src/gateway/core/config.py`) return `hybrid` when the config field `mode` is `hybrid` (legacy `platform`) or, when `mode` is unset, when the platform token (`OTARI_AI_TOKEN`) is set; otherwise `standalone`. Startup validation (`validate_mode_selection`) rejects the conflicting combinations: `OTARI_MODE=hybrid` (legacy value `platform`) without a token, and `OTARI_MODE=standalone` or `OTARI_MODE=hosted` with a token set (the token would otherwise silently select hybrid). The token is resolved once at config-load time (cached on the config), not re-read from `os.getenv` on every access.
- **Standalone**: provider credentials come from the `providers:` block in `config.yml`; users/keys/budgets/usage live in the local DB. All routers are registered.
- **Hosted** (`OTARI_MODE=hosted`) is standalone's multi-tenant variant, not a third runtime: same database, same management API, same sign-in, and `is_hybrid_mode` is false. Two things differ. What `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` publishes, `deployment_type: "hosted"` and `HOSTED_SURFACES` rather than `STANDALONE_SURFACES`, which drops the process-global `providers` page (`provider_credentials` is keyed on instance name alone, so one row serves every tenant). The organization-scoped `organization_providers` page is on both rosters: the two are disjoint mechanisms (see `models/provider_keys.py`), so a standalone deployment publishes both and a hosted one publishes only the second. Hiding a page is not a guard over the table; #818 tracks that. And the data plane: `_register_core_routers` mounts the inference routers only when `not is_hosted_mode`, and `api/routes/hosted_mode.py` answers those prefixes with a 404 naming the reason (and the `data_plane_url` to use, where one is set), because inference belongs on a hybrid gateway whose usage report is what debits the wallet (#822). `/api/v1/models` stays mounted, since discovery is not dispatch.
- **Hybrid**: per-request provider credentials are resolved from the platform service (otari.ai); local DB/user/budget management is skipped and usage is reported upstream. `register_routers()` (`src/gateway/api/main.py`) only mounts `chat`, `messages`, `responses`, `health`, and `bootstrap`; management routers (keys/users/budgets/pricing/usage/etc.) are standalone-only. `bootstrap` (`GET /api/v1/bootstrap`) is mounted in both modes and is unauthenticated, because it is how a browser learns which mode it reached; see [web/AGENTS.md](web/AGENTS.md).
- Hybrid mode spans two trust contexts that this codebase treats identically: a gateway someone self-hosts against otari.ai using a workspace's own (BYO) provider keys, and the gateway mozilla.ai operates as part of otari.ai, which additionally serves mozilla.ai-managed models. The managed-vs-BYO boundary (platform-owned upstream credentials are returned only to mozilla.ai's gateway, never to a self-hosted one) is enforced on the platform side (otari-ai), not here. User-facing explanation lives in `docs/modes.md`; the wire contract in `docs/hybrid-mode-protocol.md`.

The per-request flow (auth → budget → dispatch → reconciliation) spans several files and is documented in [src/gateway/AGENTS.md](src/gateway/AGENTS.md). Read it before changing request behavior.

## Lint / Typecheck
- Prefer a `make` target to the tool it wraps, and read `make help` before reaching past one: the target list grows, so something that had no target last time may have one now. A target bundles checks the bare tool skips, which is how a check goes unrun when the tool is called directly. Where `make help` offers nothing, call the tool; the dashboard's own checks (pnpm, below) are the gap today.
- Run lint checks with `make lint`, and type checks with `make typecheck`. Each runs a Python half and a dashboard half, which CI runs as separate jobs: `lint-python`/`lint-web` and `typecheck-python`/`typecheck-web`. Both linters fix what they can in place, so a run can leave changes to commit, and CI fails when a fix changed a file.
- `make lint-python` runs every hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: the architecture check, the Alembic single-head check, `ruff check` and `ruff format`. **Ruff alone is not equivalent.** That file is the one list of Python lint checks, so a new check goes there as a hook, not into the Makefile.
- The architecture check (`scripts/check_architecture.py`, also `make check-architecture`) enforces the `src/gateway/` layer rules: services must not import the API layer, repositories must not import services or the API layer, schemas must not import services, repositories, exceptions, the API layer or the composition root, API routes must not import `sqlalchemy.orm`, `gateway/main.py` must not import a route module, a service or a route must not import the feature registry (`gateway/features.py`), nothing under `gateway/` imports an entry-point discovery module (`importlib.metadata`, `importlib_metadata`, `pkg_resources`), repository modules end in `_repository.py` (a module that bundles a domain's repositories, in `_repositories.py`), `src/` holds no top-level package but `gateway`, nothing under `cli/src/otari_agent` imports the gateway or the server stack it drags in (uvicorn, any-llm, SQLAlchemy, pydantic, FastAPI), and nothing under `services/` or `api/routes/` imports `sqlalchemy` or `sqlmodel` unless it is on that layer's baseline of modules that still do. Both baselines only shrink: an entry that stops importing either fails the check until it is removed. `services/` and `repositories/` gain no top-level module unless it is on the check's baseline of flat modules that exist, so new code goes in its domain's package. An entry whose module no longer exists fails the check until it is removed. Only the Unit of Work calls `commit()` or `rollback()`, unless the module is on the check's baseline of modules that still call either, only `repositories/` imports `session_for`, and only `get_unit_of_work` or a worker factory in `core/unit_of_work.py` constructs a `UnitOfWork`. Every package in `services/` or `repositories/` and every module in `schemas/` or `exceptions/` is named for a domain that `docs/domains.md` gives a section, unless it is on the check's baseline of names that do not match yet. Only a domain's own service and repository packages and `api/deps.py` import `repositories.<domain>`, unless the module and the domain it imports are a pair on the check's baseline of imports that still do.
- `make lint-web` runs Biome over the dashboard with its fixes applied (formatting, recommended rules, and the `web/src/` layer boundaries), and `make typecheck-web` runs `tsc`. See [web/AGENTS.md](web/AGENTS.md) for what those boundaries are and why the config mirrors `otari-ai/frontend`.
- If introducing a formatter/linter, keep changes in a separate PR unless requested.

## Test Notes
- There is no global rerun policy in `pytest.ini`. A blanket `reruns` would let a test that
  passes one time in several count as green, hiding flakiness and ordering
  bugs suite-wide. Mark a genuinely flaky test with
  `@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=...)` (from `pytest-rerunfailures`) and say why,
  rather than reintroducing a global retry.
- Integration tests need PostgreSQL: `TEST_DATABASE_URL` if set, otherwise a Testcontainers `postgres:17`, so without Docker the suite cannot start. Whichever it is, it is a *server* URL: each xdist worker creates a database of its own on it (`postgres` becomes `postgres_gw0`, and so on) and drops it at the end of the session, so the credentials it points at need `CREATE DATABASE` and a `postgres` database to connect through. Two suites must not share one server URL: they pick the same worker database names and drop each other's database mid-run. SQLite is not a fallback even though `_to_async_url` accepts one: none of that is available there. With no Docker, point `TEST_DATABASE_URL` at any reachable PostgreSQL instead.
- The schema is built once per worker, not once per test. `tests/integration/conftest.py` runs the migration chain on first use and then returns each test a clean database by truncating it and restoring the migration-seeded rows (`clean_database`, autouse). A fixture that needs a client on a config of its own gets it from `build_test_client`, which is why no test module drops tables any more: dropping them would take the schema out from under every later test on that worker. The app object is likewise built once per worker per distinct config (`app_for`) and only its lifespan runs per test, so state a test puts on the app outside the lifespan outlives the test unless the conftest's `_refresh_process_state` redoes it.
- The OSS-edition smoke gate (`scripts/oss_edition_smoke.py`, run by
  `otari-oss-edition.yml` on any PR touching the app, the migrations, or dependency
  resolution) boots the packaged CLI as a subprocess with no overlay
  bootstrap and no platform token, then walks health, key creation, a stored BYO
  provider credential, a fallback-routed completion against a mock provider, and
  the usage row. Run it locally with
  `uv run --frozen --no-dev python scripts/oss_edition_smoke.py`; it defaults to a
  throwaway SQLite file, so it needs no Docker, and `--database-url` points it at
  PostgreSQL as CI does. Keep it standard-library only and keep it running under
  `--no-dev`: that is what makes it able to catch a dev-only or enterprise-only
  import that reached an OSS code path, and a single third-party import in it
  (httpx, pyyaml) gives that up. `scripts/hybrid_edition_smoke.py` is its hybrid
  sibling in the same workflow: the packaged CLI booted with a platform token
  against standard-library fakes of the control plane, an OpenAI/Anthropic
  provider, an MCP server, a search service and a code-execution sandbox, asserting on the requests the fakes recorded
  (resolve bodies, tokens, usage reports) as well as the responses. Same rules:
  standard library only, run under `--no-dev`, and no database, because a hybrid
  gateway runs none. `--image <tag>` runs the same walk against the built
  container instead of the source checkout, which `otari-docker-build.yml` does
  after its liveness check: the image pins `OTARI_HOST`/`OTARI_PORT` as env, and
  env beats a mounted config file, so an image that boots but cannot serve a
  request fails only there. A streamed leg covers SSE end to end and the `ttft_ms`
  only a streamed attempt reports, and a streamed tool loop runs an MCP tool
  mid-stream and must still end in `[DONE]` with its usage reported.
  `--live` swaps the provider fake for the real OpenAI and
  Anthropic APIs (`OTARI_SMOKE_*_API_KEY`, Tavily optional) and runs from
  `otari-live-providers.yml` on pushes to `main`, the commit the otari.ai dev
  gateway deploys; it is not a PR gate, because forks carry no secrets and a real
  model is not deterministic enough to block a merge on.
- Two tests assert the provider-error sanitization by making a real outbound call (`test_error_detail_leakage.py::test_provider_error_does_not_leak_details`, `test_streaming_error_event.py::test_streaming_creation_error_returns_http_error`). With no network egress the upstream fails differently and both report a status mismatch, so treat them as environment noise rather than a regression, and confirm a change against the rest of the suite.
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_dependency_ceiling.py::test_mcp_constraint_resolves_to_an_importable_version` also needs network egress, to install `mcp` fresh from PyPI into a throwaway venv. Unlike the two above, a missing egress here does not look like a status mismatch: it fails hard after burning both `@pytest.mark.flaky` reruns. It also skips outright (not fails) when `uv` is not on `PATH`.
- `tests/unit/test_url_safety.py` and `tests/unit/test_web_search_backend.py` need DNS, which is a third signature again: the code under test resolves a hostname to an IP to decide whether an address is safe, so with no resolver it gets the hostname back and the failure reads `ValueError: 'example.com' does not appear to be an IPv4 or IPv6 address`. Six tests across the two files, all passing where DNS is available. Nothing about the address checks is wrong; confirm with `python -c "import socket; socket.gethostbyname('example.com')"` before treating one as a regression.

## Generated Artifacts
- The Postman collection is generated **from** `docs/public/openapi.json`, so it goes stale
  whenever the spec does, including for a change that only edits a route's
  docstring (descriptions are carried into the collection). Regenerate both and commit
  both: `uv run python scripts/generate_openapi.py`, then `make postman`. Note there is
  no `make openapi` target; `make openapi-check` only validates. Verify with
  `make openapi-check` and `make postman-check`. The same `openapi-spec` CI job runs both
  checks, so missing this fails CI even when `openapi-check` passes.
- **A new route also owes `scripts/sdk_codegen/sdk-endpoints.txt`**, which is a
  hand-maintained manifest rather than a generated file, and the one artifact in
  this list that a spec regeneration does not fix.
  `tests/unit/test_sdk_endpoint_coverage.py` fails until every `METHOD path` the
  spec exposes appears under `[covered]` or `[excluded]` with a reason, which is
  deliberate: the codegen workflow pushes the file into all four SDK repos, so
  classifying a new endpoint here is what keeps them in step, and the drift
  fails in the repo that caused it.
- `docs/public/code-execution-openapi.yaml` is the exception in that directory: it is
  **hand-maintained**, not generated. It specifies a backend Otari calls, so no app here
  serves those paths and `generate_openapi.py` neither reads nor writes it. Edit it
  together with `docs/code-execution-protocol.md`, which is normative for the semantics a
  schema cannot carry; `tests/unit/test_code_execution_contract.py` fails when the two
  disagree, and `scripts/check_code_execution_conformance.py` checks a live backend
  against it.
- The Homebrew formula in `mozilla-ai/homebrew-tap` (`Formula/otari.rb`) is rendered at
  release by `otari-homebrew.yml` from `packaging/homebrew/otari.rb.tmpl` and `uv.lock`
  (`scripts/homebrew_formula.py`, standard library only). Never edit the tap's copy; change
  the template, and `make homebrew-formula` shows the result. Its resource stanzas are the
  light CLI's dependency closure with each package's sdist URL and hash from the lock, so
  `tests/unit/test_homebrew_formula.py` fails a PR that adds a heavy or wheel-only dependency
  to `cli/`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and the GitHub Release body are generated from Conventional
  Commits by git-cliff (`cliff.toml`) at release time, not per-PR. Because PRs are
  squash-merged, the PR title is what git-cliff parses; `otari-pr-title.yml`
  enforces a conventional title. Visibility rules live in `RELEASE.md`
  ("Changelog visibility"). Do not hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`; the release
  workflows regenerate it.
- The dashboard has three more, and [web/AGENTS.md](web/AGENTS.md) owns them: its API client
  (`web/src/client/schema.ts`) and route tree (`web/src/routeTree.gen.ts`) are generated **and
  committed**, each with a CI drift check, while the bundle (`src/gateway/static/dashboard/`)
  is generated and **not** committed. A change under `web/src` therefore sometimes leaves a
  file to commit and never leaves a bundle to commit. Screenshot baselines are a fourth
  artifact that is deliberately neither: the suite runs on demand and its PNGs are gitignored
  while the dashboard is mid-migration.
- Raising the `mcp` ceiling is an API change, not just a dependency bump.
  `POST /api/v1/mcp/execute` answers with mcp's own `CallToolResult`, so ten
  mcp-owned schemas (`CallToolResult`, `TextContent`, `ImageContent`,
  `AudioContent`, `ResourceLink`, `EmbeddedResource`, `Annotations`,
  `BlobResourceContents`, `TextResourceContents`, `Icon`) live in
  `docs/public/openapi.json` and travel from there into the Postman collection
  and `web/src/client/schema.ts`. An mcp release that touches any of those
  shapes therefore changes three committed files with drift checks over them.
  That is why `pyproject.toml` pins mcp to one minor line: left open, a
  `uv lock` run for an unrelated dependency would move those artifacts as a
  side effect and fail CI on a diff that explained none of it. So a bump means
  raising the ceiling *and* regenerating both public artifacts and the
  dashboard client in the same change. The native result is deliberate (a
  gateway-owned mirror model would silently drop any content block type a
  future mcp adds), so the cost is paid here rather than in the response shape.

## Docs
`docs/` is the published documentation, and [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) is its map,
grouped by reader: start here, operators, integrators, platform builders, contributors.
Read the page covering the area you are changing before you change it, and update that
page in the same PR when behavior moves. Nothing fails when a docs page goes stale,
unlike the artifacts above, so a reader finds the drift rather than CI.

Some pages bind code rather than describe it:

- [docs/domains.md](docs/domains.md) is the backend's target shape: what each layer
  holds and what each domain owns. New backend code goes in its domain's target
  location, not beside the code it most resembles. A new domain needs a section there
  before it gets a package or a schemas or exceptions module, or the architecture check
  fails.
- [docs/hybrid-mode-protocol.md](docs/hybrid-mode-protocol.md) and
  [docs/code-execution-protocol.md](docs/code-execution-protocol.md) are the wire
  contracts a peer implements. They are normative for the semantics a schema cannot
  carry, so a change to the wire is a change to the page first.

## Repository Conventions
- Prefer minimal, targeted edits over broad refactors, and match the import order and typing style of the file you are in (`TYPE_CHECKING` for type-only imports where it helps, as in `routes/_helpers.py`).
- Add a comment only where the logic is not obvious; keep docstrings concise and meaningful on public functions and classes. Do not restate the code, narrate the change, or record what the code used to do: the commit message is where that belongs. Leave the comments around a change shorter than you found them: prune narration, repeated rationale, and implementation history as you touch them.
- A docblock belongs immediately above the declaration it describes, and the way it stops doing so is an insertion. When you add a declaration beside an existing documented one, put the new pair above or below the whole block, never between a block and what it documents, and do not move the existing declaration to make room: moving it is what opens the gap the next insertion falls into. Four of these are in the tree, three of them written in one day, and none is reachable by lint, typecheck or any test, because a comment over the wrong thing compiles. `grep -rP -l '\*/\n[ \t]*/\*\*' web/src` finds it: two docblocks with nothing between them but horizontal space. The horizontal-only class is the whole discriminator, because a module header sits a **blank** line above the first declaration's own block while a stranded block is **flush** against the next one, the declaration that separated them having moved. `\s*` spans the blank line and turns the ordinary arrangement into eight false positives. Still not a gate: a section comment deliberately placed above another block is legal, so a hit is worth reading rather than presumed wrong. And do not add `-z`: the shell's `grep` is ugrep, which has `-P`, but any `z` among the flags routes the call to the system BSD grep, which does not, and the query then dies with a usage block that scrolls like output while a pipe reports its own exit code instead of the failure.
- A workaround for an any-llm gap is a legitimate change here. Keep it minimal and follow the convention in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#when-the-fix-is-upstream-but-otari-cannot-wait) (`service_tier` in `src/gateway/api/routes/chat.py` is the worked example).
- Preserve security-relevant behavior: header parsing, auth checks, and the error-detail boundary. Do not leak internals in public error responses, and never log secrets, tokens, or raw API keys (the one-time bootstrap key print is the deliberate exception).
- Otari's own HTTP headers are named `Otari-*`, never `X-`. RFC 6648 (BCP 178) says creators of new parameters "SHOULD NOT prefix their parameter names with 'X-' or similar constructs": https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6648. No lint rule or type error reaches that, so `tests/unit/test_header_naming.py` holds the gate: every `X-` literal under `src/gateway` is classified either as a name Otari inherited and cannot rename alone (`x-api-key` is Anthropic's, `X-RateLimit-*` is what clients already parse) or as a literal naming no header at all (`x-ai` is a provider id), and anything unclassified fails. Both lists only shrink, so a retired name cannot sit there pre-authorizing a future one. Scoping the check to `X-Otari-` is the obvious move and the wrong one: it passes a header of ours spelled any other way, which is how `X-Correlation-ID` survived the first sweep. `src/gateway` is the whole scope, because that is where a header reaches the wire, so the `x-otari-optional` OpenAPI specification extension under `docs/public/` is never scanned, and that spec requires its prefix anyway. The open case is the two platform tokens, `X-Gateway-Token` and `X-User-Token`, in #1486: they are request headers on a two-sided contract, so otari.ai must accept a new name before Otari can send one.
- Keep test additions next to the behavior they cover: unit for pure logic, integration for route or database behavior.
- CI runs Python 3.14 (`.github/workflows/otari-tests.yml`), matching the Docker image; the package still supports 3.13+ (`requires-python = ">=3.13"`).

## Change Validation Checklist
- If you touched API routes or schemas, run relevant integration tests first.
- If you touched DB models/repositories, run related integration tests and migration paths.
- If you touched config loading, run config/env tests in `tests/integration`.
- If you touched CLI behavior, run `tests/unit/test_gateway_cli.py`, `tests/unit/test_otari_agent_cli.py`, `tests/unit/test_hook_cli.py` and `tests/unit/test_hook_setup_cli.py`.
- If you touched auth headers or key handling, run key-management and auth-related tests.
- If OpenAPI-affecting code changed, including a route docstring, regenerate and commit **both**
  generated artifacts (see Generated Artifacts above).
- If you moved code across a layer, added a port, or bound an adapter, check the change
  against [Cardinal rules for contributors](ARCHITECTURE.md#cardinal-rules-for-contributors)
  and run `make lint`.
- If you changed behavior a docs page describes, update that page in the same PR (see Docs
  above). A new domain owes [docs/domains.md](docs/domains.md) a section.

## Writing style

- Avoid em dashes and double hyphens (`--`) used as separators in prose
  (README, docs, doc comments, commit messages, PR descriptions). Use commas,
  semicolons, colons, parentheses, or periods, or rephrase. This does not apply
  to code (for example CLI flags like `--all`) or en-dash numeric ranges like `3–4`.
- Spell prose in **US English** (`behavior`, `recognize`, `serialize`, `catalog`,
  `labeled`, `license`, `color`). This covers docs, READMEs, comments,
  docstrings, commit messages, and user-visible UI copy, which is what the
  dashboard already uses (`Default pricing catalog`) and what otari.ai's own nav
  says (`Organization`).
- Three things keep whatever spelling they already have, because they are not
  ours to respell: an identifier or attribute borrowed from an external API
  (`aria-labelledby`, `asyncio.CancelledError`, GitHub's `cancelled` job
  conclusion), a value that travels on the wire or into a database, and a
  third-party product's own name. `cancelled` is therefore left alone repo-wide:
  it names an asyncio method and a CI conclusion far more often than it appears
  as prose, and splitting the spelling by context would read as a typo either way.
