"""Check gateway architectural boundaries.

Enforces:
1. Service layer boundaries: services must not import the API layer.
2. API route purity: routes must not use the sync ORM layer (sqlalchemy.orm).
3. Repository boundaries: repositories must not import services or the API layer.
4. Naming conventions: repository modules end in _repository.py.
5. OSS/enterprise boundary: OSS code must not import the enterprise overlay.
6. Port boundaries: a port may describe the domain but not import a caller or an adapter.
7. Composition root: only gateway/container.py may name a concrete adapter.
8. Entrypoint purity: gateway/main.py may not import a route module.
9. Registry: only the app wiring reads gateway/features.py, so a service or a
   route may not import it; and nothing under gateway/ imports
   importlib.metadata, importlib_metadata or pkg_resources, so nothing is
   discovered.
10. Top-level packages: src/ holds only the packages on an explicit list, so a
    feature cannot sit beside gateway/, outside every rule above.
11. Service database access: nothing under services/ imports sqlalchemy or
    sqlmodel, so a service can neither build a query nor name the session type.
12. Route database access: nothing under api/routes/ imports sqlalchemy or
    sqlmodel, so a route reaches the database through a service. Rules 11 and
    12 each name the modules that still import one on a baseline, and each
    baseline only shrinks.
13. Domain packages: services/ and repositories/ gain no top-level module, so
    new code goes in its domain's package, and every directory of modules in
    either layer has an __init__.py. The flat modules that exist are named on
    a baseline, and the baseline only shrinks.
14. Transaction control: only the Unit of Work calls commit or rollback, so a
    transaction ends where its block does. Modules that still call either are
    named on a baseline, and the baseline only shrinks.
15. Session accessor: only a repository imports session_for, so every query
    stays in the repository layer.
16. Schema boundaries: a schema does not import the API, service, repository or
    exception layer, or the composition root, so a request or response model
    carries no behavior from another layer.
17. Unit of Work construction: only the request's factory builds one, outside
    the module that defines it and holds the worker factories, so a scope has
    exactly one and an inner block still joins the outer one.
18. Light CLI: nothing under cli/src/otari_agent imports the gateway or the
    server stack it drags in (uvicorn, any-llm, SQLAlchemy, pydantic,
    FastAPI), so the `otari` command ships alone with a handful of pure-Python
    dependencies. The one exemption is otari_agent/cli.py, which names
    gateway.cli inside a find_spec guard to attach the server commands when
    the gateway is installed too. The member lives outside src/ on purpose:
    rule 10 keeps src/ to the gateway, and this one keeps the CLI out of it.
19. Domain names: a package in services/ or repositories/, a module in
    schemas/ and a module in exceptions/ take their domain from their name, so
    each name is a domain that docs/domains.md gives a section. An exceptions
    module is named <domain>_exceptions.py. The names that do not match yet are
    on a baseline, and the baseline only shrinks.
20. Repository imports: only a domain's own service package, its own
    repository package and the builders in gateway/api/deps.py import
    repositories.<domain>, so a domain's queries stay behind its service. Each
    module that still imports another domain's repositories is on a baseline
    with the domain package it imports, and the baseline only shrinks.
21. Service package imports: code outside a domain service package imports
    only its root, so the root's exports are the domain's whole public API.
    Each module that still imports below another domain's root is on a
    baseline with the module it imports, and the baseline only shrinks.
